#+DESCRIPTION: hello world

I guess it was only a matter of time.
It feels like I've passed the tipping point where Emacs starts to take over
more and more with exponential velocity.
My lisp skills had greatly improved from writing some small emacs packages.
The configuration grew form a simple monolithic file to a complex ecosystem
with loads of custom code.

With [[https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page/][org-page]] I can finally write a blog in org mode without ever leaving emacs.
Maybe that will lower the threshold for me. My last attempts for writing a blog haven't been successful.
Somehow it's always around 2AM when I start a project like this.
Eat sleep code repeat! Well, I guess it's time for a repeat.
